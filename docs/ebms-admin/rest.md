# REST Interface

The REST Interface is not (yet) enabled seperately but together with the SOAP interface through a [command line option](command#start-with-soap-interface).

The REST Interface implements the same api as the SOAP Interface, see also [EbMS API](/ebms-core/api.md) for an enumeration of the services/operations.

There is an OpenAPI spec located [here](https://github.com/eluinstra/ebms-core/blob/ebms-core-2.18.x/resources/test/ebms.yml).

And example/test requests located [here](https://github.com/eluinstra/ebms-core/blob/ebms-core-2.18.x/resources/test/ebms.rest).
