# SOAP Interface

The SOAP Interface can be enabled through a [command line option](command#start-with-soap-interface).

See [EbMS API](/ebms-core/api.md) for a description of the SOAP Interface.

You can find SoapUI example projects [here](https://github.com/eluinstra/ebms-core/blob/ebms-core-2.17.x/resources/test/).
