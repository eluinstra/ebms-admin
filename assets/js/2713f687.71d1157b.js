EbMS Messages are usually signed to verify the originator. Sometimes they are also encrypted. The SSL, Signing and Encryption certificates are also defined in the CPA. Also the endpoint URLs which are used to communicate between the 2 parties are defined in the CPA. So you need different CPAs for your Development, Acceptance and Production environments.
